    <p class="intro"><span class="introStyle">At Aurora Ski Chalet,</span> we aim to provide you a unique experience in order to give you a memorable journey here in Norway.
      We are uniquely located to view the Northern Lights as easily as possible. The best times to view the Lights
      tend to be between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. As such, we will have a guide to come with you to view the Lights securely
      and safely.</p>
